On first opening, I couldn't do anything. Windows was always freezing up (literally every click caused a crash), so I thought it maybe needed an update but the update actually made it worse. Turns out, the Qualcomm processor is incompatible with the November 2021 version of windows. Seriously, if it's this obsolete despite being released only a few years ago, why still have it listed?Save yourself the time and don't buy this glorified paperweight. I live abroad and wanted a US keyboard so now I have to go through the process of an international return.\\n\\n4 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Repeatedly I got the message that it needed to be restarted and try again during the set up stage. The laptop became completely unresponsive at one point and locked up. After 20 minutes of dealing with this issue I tried to power cycle it and it would not power off. I waited another hour and then it finally rebooted only this time all I got was a black screen. This lasted for over 30 minutes before it rebooted on it's own again but again was unresponsive. I've been going back and forth with these issues. If I cannot resolve it I will have to return it which I'm thinking about any ways due to all the issues already which usually indicates there is either a software or hardware issue.\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

ABSOLUTE UNPERTURBED JOY! amazing touch responsiveness, the pen is stunningly accurate as well (and it nests and charges itself RIGHT above the keyboard! where there is ALSO a sim card tray for your 5G! I mean WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR, PEOPLE?however..this awesome little thing has certain caveats, that the all new HP Dragonfly Folio has bettered on (please, dear Amazon, stock this as well!), in that the HP Elite Folio comes equipped with an all new Snapdragon 8 ARM64 processor, which may run as cool as an iceberg (so NO FANS needed!) and can save you a lot of hassle in battery charging (ALMOST ONE DAY USE WITH A FULL CHARGE! INSAAAAAANEEEE!), but it does not support a lot of apps that you are used to using, and most certainly, it does NOT support ALMOST 99% of the pc games you are used to playing! the darn processor, being ARM64, will drive you crazy, if gaming was your original idea when you bought this little thing!..if, on the other hand, you are looking for a laptop for work (or travelling and working) AND a fashion statement (IN ABSOLUTE LOVE WITH THE LEATHER-BOUND COVER!), JUST BUY THIS! HANDS DOWN THE BEST OPTION FOR THE MONEY!my two cents? don't buy this, save some more, and go straight for the Dragonfly Folio, which is kinda steep at the moment (+2300 bux!) but its' processor's architecture is far more open, since it carries the latest Intel i7 processors! and doubles up on the RAM as well, set at 32 GB!it's up to you whichever of the two (Elite vs Dragonfly) you choose, but the Elite Folio was a very pleasant surprise, the leather-bound cover is to-die-for! and the battery? LEGENDARY!p.s. tbh, I am FOR SURE buying the HP Dragonfly Folio next year, but if HP Omen Folio comes out next year, I am gonna be a very, VERY happy guy! ;)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I've been running Chromebooks for a few years, left the Mac crowd for better security, and now I have this problem.  I'll start by saying I like Chromebooks, cheap, reliable, solid state, regular updates.  That's the good stuff.  The not so good stuff is the message that loaded onto the startup screen that said to powerwash it  first.  I'd never seen that.  I thought it was strange, and as time went on, I thought maybe this Lenovo is a refurb.  It came in a Lenovo box, with all the Lenovo stickers and bar codes. but was packed, no, tossed into a box that half a dozen would have fit inside along with about 15 inches of brown packing paper -thanks for a 5th rate packing job D&H Distributing.  It rattled and thumped back and forth inside the shipping box such that I thought there must be pieces crashing around in there.  I told the driver as much, and he took off immediately.It ran seriously slow at first.  I couldn't figure it out.  Checked the wifi router, hooked into the ethernet with an adapter, there isn't one on the Lenovo, ran a few other tests thinking it would have to be something external, brand new out of the box Chromebook.  But then I remembered the suggestion  on the start up screen.I powerwashed it.  That helped.  I found and deleted cookies.  That helped some more.  Then I started digging.  I found extensions I don't use, website addresses I don't visit,  and tasks I have never heard of running in the background.  Powerwashing didn't get them.  I eliminated all those things, powerwashed it again and the performance was much better but not nearly what it should be.  Amazon streaming is iffy, but Amazon and Google have running battles we get caught up in, YouTube buffers regularly, pressing the forward or reverse keys helps on both issues, but i understand it is a $150 unit.  I don't expect the speed and precision of my Apple stuff, but I was under the impression I was buying a new Chromebook, and it may be new, but someone else left their sites on it.I got mine from D&H Distributing in Illinois.  I'm going to keep it for the price alone, but be advised: if you get a notice to powerwash on startup, do it.  Then start running down the footprints.  Run the task manager, the cookie cutters, and check with 'about Chrome' in the settings.  Then powerwash it again.  But don't get too confident that you have it clean.  Some of the things I learned herein are  powerwashing doesn't get everything, it is possible to get a new computer someone else has used, and it is possible to get a refurb sold as new.\\n\\n8 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

The size is right, the keys feel great, the track pad is fine. The screen resolution is perfect for a Chromebook. I like how well this thing keeps a charge, and charges quickly. USB-C can\\'t be beat, and it still has a headphone jack, HDMI, regular USB and a slot for SD cards. If you\\'re in the market for a Chromebook, you can\\'t do much better especially for the price. The previous Lenovo Chromebook I had is still kicking - I can\\'t believe how much value I get out of a sub-$180 laptop. Just wanted something a little bigger than the 11\" Chromebook I already had. Perfect for traveling.Keep in mind:- Not a PC or a Mac (if that is really truly what you think you want or need, look elsewhere and expect to spend 3x)- Do you research about what a Chromebook actually is. All you 1, 2, and 3 star reviewers complaining that its not a PC or Macbook look like goobers in your reviews. It\\'s essentially a web-browser, which for most people is all you need (Facebook, Netflix, look at memes, email, pay bills online, etc.). You can even use the browser version of the Microsoft suite if you\\'re feeling in the mood to do some work.- Even if the price was 2x, you can\\'t complain about the screen resolution, or the hard drive size, or the lack of back-lit keyboard.- Plenty of RAM for what you intend to do on a Chromebook- Not a touch-screen. Don\\'t be surprised.Things I\\'d like to see improved:- Give me an 8GB RAM option just for kicks. 4 is fine, but RAM is cheap these days.- Flush-mount SD Card slot\\n\\n58 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

And the battery life is great; so far I’ve been able to get more than 9 hours of battery life with it.UPDATE 11.2019 -- I stick by my review and have even taken it on a couple of business trips and used it during meetings. The battery life certainly is one of its strongest assets. As other people were plugging in laptops about 4 hours into a recent meeting I was in, I never had to reach for mine. The keyboard also is very quiet and comfortable. There isn't a lot of onboard storage for files, but I keep a couple of USB drives with me and I also have an external drive that's powered through the USB port. When I need to use a mouse, I use a Logitech blutooth model, which allows me to keep the single USB port available for the external hard drive or USB drive. I've also connected this Chromebook to an external monitor via the HDMI port with no problems -- it wasn't even necessary to configure anything as the Chromebook just recognized it was there, so I had an expanded desktop. For traveling and doing work on the road, it definitely fits my needs. The price also is tough to beat for a budget Chromebook.\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I charge it to its fullest capacity at night, but the next day the battery runs low about 5 hours after I start using it. Also, it started spontaneously shutting down yesterday-(the battery was charged and it was not running hot) so I'm not sure what is going on. My last chromebook lasted about 6 years before I had to replace it, so this is a true disappointment that this one is having issues within one month of purchase. I will continue to  use it because I had a specific budget and need it for work now,  but next time, I will pass on this brand.\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

This is my first Chromebook, but I've been using my tablet primarily for a month or so and concluded that don't need to deal with clunky windows.This is a budget device and that's obvious from there feel of it. But that's ok with me. It's lightweight and pretty responsive. That's what I want, since this device is just for writing, some basic spreadsheet work and podcast recording. Simple enough.So it should be clear to you, dear reader, that I'm not one of the irrational people who gets super picky people about every technical aspect of a computer, especially at such a low price point. That being said, I have one big problem with this device.The screen resolution is so bad that the device is hard to stare at for more than a few minutes. It's unbelievably grainy, beyond what could be blamed on anti-glare protection. You can brighten the screen, but there's NO WAY to change the contrast. Come on folks, contrast is not a high end feature.Because I don't want to deal with sending this back and I have work to do, I'm going to try to make this work. So far I installed a night mode app which did improve things a bit. Next I'll change the desktop. Fingers crossed.I'll update this as needed.\\n\\n268 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

This thing when the fan blows you can hear it and also sometimes it gets really slow so I can't multitask. I mean basically it's slower than a refurbish 10 years old Lenovo ThinkPad but most time it works fine. You see I bought this thing to replace the 10 years old refurbish Lenovo for the most part it's fine but for some odd reason sometimes it gets really slow and then the Apple Music APP just stops working. It happened today so I got angry and switch back to the Lenovo ThinkPad. The way it is I think it would be better if it backs up the Lenovo ThinkPad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

For the price it was then I feel like it's worth it. The screen isn't great but not bad either. I really like the size. I don't think it's too small like some reviews said. That being said, I'm not wild about the Chrome OS. You can only use applications which come from the Google Play store, and not all of them are available for the laptop Chrome OS. And some function weird, or differently. Have limited functionality. Do your research to see if a ChromeBook is good enough for what you need before getting one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I\\'ve now had this chromebook for over a year and a half and have had no problems with it. It\\'s light, sturdy, very comfortable to use with very decent sound, mic, camera for video conferencing.  This is my 3rd chromebook, and usually after a year, the screen, mouse, keyboard, or SOMETHING starts to act up.  No such issues this time around. I use it everyday, primarily for work-related tasks.  The screen-size is decent, but I also have a Chromecast so I can just \"beam\" my computer onto my big screen  TV whenever I want to.

The screen contrast is not very good and can be difficult to see from some angles.  Turning up the brightness only makes it worse.  With Adobe ending flash it has made using school applications and web applications painful to use, sometimes unusable, and webcam difficult.  I bought this for my kids to use for online school tasks and they have had problems because of the flash limitations. Only a single USB port.....come on guys....this Cbook doesn't have touchscreen so having only a single USB port is very limiting.  It hooks up to both standard WiFi and 5G without issue.  My background is with PCs and I am not a fan of the scrolling on this laptop given that it does not have a touchscreen.  Hooking up a USB mouse nearly a requirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Bought for elderly mother in April \\'21 but didn\\'t activate until Sept \\'21 due to her hospitalization. In March \\'22, the machine started acting up (would turn off suddenly) until later that month the Chrome OS crashed. Contacted Lenovo\\'s \"awesome\" customer service and they dumped it off onto Google (I get that it\\'s a software issue), which only has web support (i.e., no human beings). Followed prompts to reinstall Chrome OS via online support but all it gave me was a black screen. Consulted online forums and tried their suggestions to no avail. Of course, since it\\'s out of warranty (even though it was only used maybe two dozen times for about an hour each), the Chromebook is a black-screen paperweight. Several computer repair shops offered to fix for more than the machine is worth. Never again. Lenovo lost my business FOREVER.

For this particular model of chrome book, I need more screen resolution because I was constantly having to adjust the screen to see.  Also need more than 32 GB storage because I learned that programs cannot be installed and run from the sd card. I returned this unit for these reasons, not because there was anything wrong with the hardware or opration of the Chromebook.

We sent it back to Lenovo for repair and it came back with the repair ticket stating the battery has been replaced.  In the meantime, while it was getting \"repaired\", the warranty ran out.  I contacted Lenovo to let them know the Chromebook battery is still not working properly and they  informed me the warranty has run out, so I must contact a local service center and pay for repairs.  I contested the warranty claim, since it still had the same problem as before, so therefore it was not fixed and it should still be \"under warranty\" with the original repair claim date.  I was given another phone number to call, which subsequently does not work.  I\\'d stay away from this particular product and Lenovo.\\n\\n2 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

It does buffer far too much for my liking with videos where a lot is going on. A few things that i truly dislike about it and as such i will never buy one again until they fix this is I've had three major problems with it. Problem one was in college I had an accounting class which during the final since this was in march of 2020 we all shifted to remote work. There was a recording program associated with Canvas and the chrome OS would not support it so i had to record using my phone which was silly. Second was I purchased a turtle beach headset for gaming on my xbox and on the box of the headset it said update software before you play. Well you could do that on a windows computer or a mac computer but not on a chromebook. Third was my ipad was locked out and disabled and with a windows computer i could download itunes to reset it or of course a MAC computer has it pre installed. But unless i go into Linux programming on this chromebook which is slightly complicated you can not download itunes on a chromebook. Everything else during college worked fine.

It does buffer far too much for my liking with videos where a lot is going on. A few things that i truly dislike about it and as such i will never buy one again until they fix this is I've had three major problems with it. Problem one was in college I had an accounting class which during the final since this was in march of 2020 we all shifted to remote work. There was a recording program associated with Canvas and the chrome OS would not support it so i had to record using my phone which was silly. Second was I purchased a turtle beach headset for gaming on my xbox and on the box of the headset it said update software before you play. Well you could do that on a windows computer or a mac computer but not on a chromebook. Third was my ipad was locked out and disabled and with a windows computer i could download itunes to reset it or of course a MAC computer has it pre installed. But unless i go into Linux programming on this chromebook which is slightly complicated you can not download itunes on a chromebook. Everything else during college worked fine.

From 8th grade to Senior Year, Chromebooks were part of my daily life. Now that I\\'m going into tech school, I figured I\\'d stick to the same simple to use laptops. My main desktop at home runs Linux, where I do all my \"real\" computer things, and my Android phone is my ultra portable computer. So I wanted an in between device, and Chromebooks are perfect for that. This one has a sleek, no frills design which I love. Very Lenovo. The screen is in line with what I\\'m used to seeing on a chromebook. Battery life is amazing, and the usb c charger is absolutely wonderful, as I can also charge my phone with the same cable. The cable also charged my Switch! Keyboard feels great, but I wish it had a back light. Speakers are good, on par with most chromebooks, but I mainly use bluetooth headphones. Also, Linux app support is absolutely great for me, being able to use the same apps I run on my desktop, if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

The resolution of this model number, 81JW0001US, is HD (1366x768) which is absolutely awful for a 14\" screen.Lenovo does offer a chromebook S330 with FHD (1920x1080) resolution -- that model is the 81JW000EUS and is listed on their website for $279.99 as of 6/12/2019.It does not look like the FHD model (which also comes with 64GB of storage, not the 32GB listed here) is currently available on Amazon.All the above being said, if you know for a fact that you will not be bothered by the low resolution of the screen, this is actually a pretty good buy for the price. Lenovo lists their HD (1366x768) S330 for $249.99. I have the Lenovo C330 (same internal specs and screen resolution as this model, but with a touchscreen) and it can run android applications and output Netflix fairly well to a 4K TV.\\n\\n15 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Uke2.0 out of 5 stars\\nare my eyes going bad\\nReviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019\\nEverything seems to work well (especially for the price) except for the screen.  Not very sharp, text is a little fuzzy, I feel like my eyes are going bad.  Then I switch to working on something like a Surface Pro and I realize it's not me.Purchased for a child with the assumption that they will lose it or destroy it after a few years.  Responsive touch pad, speedy enough processor for web browsing, able to download and install Android apps from the store, able to set up parental controls.  If it weren't for the screen this Chromebook would have been well worth the low price and I might have given 5 stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

After 7months the screen went almost completely black and support told me that I could pay for a service package and then they could help me. I was also told that if I didn't like the answer I could hang up and try to fix it myself. Lenovo has the worst customer service so rude and not willing to help at all. They just want to make commission on selling you a service package.
