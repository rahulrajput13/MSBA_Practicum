This version of MacBook Pro 16 inch with 16GB of RAM and 1TB hard drive is the sweet spot for the majority of people because it can meet the needs of a variety of professions, school needs, and every day use. The refurbished model I got came with the retail box, what looked to be a brand new charger and cable. I did wipe down the exterior and interior and I got quite a bit of residue and dirt off so it definitely wasn’t clean. I did notice some minor scratches on the outside shell around the hinges, otherwise it looked great everywhere else, to include the screen. The keyboard is nice and had no real signs of wear which was also nice. If you are considering a refurbished Apple product from Amazon, have confidence because Amazon backs them with a 90 day guarantee.\\n\\n4 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Only gripes are the cheap charger and version of OS it came preloaded with. It works fine, but is clearly a cheap Chinese knock off (listing states it won't come with original, so I expected this). It came loaded with an old version of OSX. No big deal since you can upgrade for free, just take more time to get it all set up. Haven't really done much as far as battery tests but it seems to hold up quite well.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the product and would buy again. This was a great deal for a 'high end' Air.\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

However, I did encounter a few problems.  Anyone who has spent time setting up a computer knows how much time it takes and if it turns out that there is a problem, you are sunk in a hole of no return.  You think, do I return the computer or try and have it fixed.  It’s one of the most frustrating of frustrations. Well that was my dilemma.One: Not sure if it is related to the computer or a flaw in Apple’s operating system. The computer had a continual sheep, hibernate error popping up. It would sleep or go into hibernate and I could not get the computer to turn back on.  I eventually had to go into an Apple forum to figure out a work-around so that I could get my work done.Two: the computer shipped with a cheap version of the Apple adapter.  Said made in China and believe me it is a cheap version.  The computer would not charge.  I thought oh no, do I have enough battery life to erase my info and return this thing or try and fix this problem.  It looked as though the problem was the connection of the cable into the computer, making me think it was the computer itself.  After a bit of toying with it we discovered it was the adapter, but the part that plugs into the wall.  As a result, I got online and ordered an adapter directly from Apple.  Just a bunch of cheap knock offs everywhere else.So far the computer is now working and functional.  Love the design and working with the new USB-C ports takes some getting adjusted to.  If you order this computer, invest in a USB-C / USB memory stick. You will need it. I do like Apple products, but can’t afford the new ones for my business.  This is a great alternative.  My suggestion is to just get the basic login set up, but don’t add any software or customization until you toy around with it to ensure it is working properly.  Something I didn’t do and should have.  Lesson learned.\\n\\n2 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Even though it's the 2015 model, the 8GB RAM in this machine will probably be better than the more expensive 4GB 2016 model.\\n\\n7 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

So, they removed MagSafe, a wonderful charging port that all Mac laptops had for years. And they replaced it with ONE USB-C port, a port that pretty much zero peripherals use, yet. So, you buy a $1300 laptop that is incapable of plugging into anything but its USB-C wall-charger. If you want to plug *anything* else you own in, well, you gotta *buy* a separate $80 DONGLE! (they recently dropped the price, but not much, and it should be INCLUDED.) This dongle then gives you one standard USB port, HDMI out (no sound throughput), and a single USB-C breakout (which means you will be able to charge with the dongle plugged in, but still be incapable of plugging in another USB-C peripheral at the same time, since, you know, still one port). It also feels like it cost .50 cents to make, which makes the insult of paying another $80 for it even more infuriating. Apple's new design idiom of forced dongle breakout for plugging anything into their hardware is sad and really, poor design. Yay, out of the box a product was a centimeter thinner, and lacking one more supposed eyesore of a port, but then the product immediately becomes uglier by the immediate necessity of half a dozen large appendages dangling off its side. It should be pointed out that Apple's current iPhone headphones cannot even plug into any of their computers... unless you add a dongle for that too!- A unique keyboard that I enjoyed typing on at first also feels very fragile - and it is. Even before the warranty expired, it started to have sticking keys and non-responsiveness more than far cheaper laptops I've previously used.- The processing power for the price is embarrassing. For a $1300 laptop in this day and age, websites shouldn't jitter and drop frames on scrolling. It's ridiculous how underpowered this puppy is. Oh, and forget gaming. It can hardly run even Diablo III within a framerate that's usable. Consider this a $1300 word processor with a keyboard prone to sticking and breaking. So, that alone is sort of makes this a non-recommendable product.At the end of the day, I could never recommend this machine to anyone. It's very frustrating, because more than any other machine I've ever picked up, I love holding and looking at it. But its ultimate abilities and build quality issues make it something to avoid. It is the definition of form over function.On the whole, with the recent release of similarly-overpriced, underpowered, head-scratching-features MacBook Pros, along with this beautifully designed, unusable machine, I'm very worried for Apple's Mac future. After over 16 years of Apple use, with my next computer, I am very likely to be returning to Windows. Microsoft has made great progress, and the value of high-powered gaming laptops (also great for power-hungry programs from Adobe) is far more reasonable in this price range. It breaks my heart, and I hope Apple decides to embrace the Mac again and clean up their inconsistencies and half-hearted usability choices.\\n\\n7 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Granted, the M2 is slower than the M1 Pro, but if you use it for not very complicated projects, it sure pays off. I can go on with this guy for a full day at work and still have plenty of battery left.The downside is that it has only 2 USB-C ports and one of then is used for charging. I personally do not mind it as I am not using it for video work - though it does perform quite well on quick media reformatting. However, it does spike the temperature when you push it.If you travel a lot and need a system that will get you through without looking for a plug all the time, this one is a great solution. And unlike a Windows laptop, it does not annihilate its performance so that it saves on battery.It's a great solution, but for simple stuff. If you are looking for video and VFX processing, look for an M1 Pro or M1 Max system - or wait for the M2 equivalents. Hopefully, Apple will fix the temperature spike issue.\\n\\n6 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Over many years, I have accumulated computers that run Windows XP, 7, 10, Linux Mint (two releases), Linux MP on lap top or desk top form.  I also use many peripherals: three external hard drives, three printers: an old HP Laserjet, a  Brother color laser, mouse, keyboard, slots for thumb drives, etc, etc.  All the computers have Intel or AMD chips.  I can manually connect any of the computers, only one at a time, to all of the peripheirals with a single USB-3 cable to change operating systems through an unpowered USB-3 hub installed backward so that the output slots are used as import slots from the various computers and the single input cord to the hub is actually used as an output to a powered USB-3 hub to which other hubs or perifiasls are connected.I have found the MacBok Pro, powerful as it is, to be severely anemic in respect to the number of USB peripherals I can connect when using a single USB-3 cable before getting the message to disconnet USB peripherals.  Added an externally powered USB-C/USB-3 hub does not resolve the problem. This limitation has not be noted in all the praise the MacBook Pro has been received, else I would not have purchased it, and makes it unsuitable for use in a desktop environment because expansion is so limited.I suspect limiting the number of peripherals was intended to extend battery life, but when the MacBook Pro is on external power as it would be when used as a desktop, the limitation should be bypassed.  This current limitation should be prominently noted in product literature and advertising so it not discovered by a disappointed buyer after a MacBook Pro is bought.\\n\\n12 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

My last laptop was no exception.  My MacBook Air 2013's screen stopped working and getting the MacBook Air M2 with 16GB was quite the jump.  This thing is fast!  I love the Touch ID on it.  It's very quiet since there's no fan. Amazingly, it stays cool too.  Granted, I'm not doing much to make it hot...websites, email, music...etc.  I did transfer around 1.2TB from an old USB portable drive to one of the SanDisk extreme SSD portables and it was slow...because of the old drive.  But once the 1TB Photos was completely on the new drive, it opens in less than a second.  I'm totally digging it.  It feels like what I was used to with a couple of changes that make it easier and faster to use.  It just works.  That works for me.\\n\\n9 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Like New!  Very, Very Happy! Thank you!\\nReviewed in the United States on November 6, 2022Verified Purchase\\nWife here.  I am very happy with this purchase.  It's my first Mac - switched from an HP PC.  I've still got much to learn about it but, so far, I LOVE it.  It's got all that a PC has AND MORE.  Software aside, the laptop came in pristine condition.  Not a scratch, not a mark.  I'm also thrilled that I bought this small size - so much more convenient, from a 15.6 PC that was way thicker, way heavier, clunky. This one even accepted my wired Evoluent mouse, with an adapter.  It would not migrate my files but Apple told me to forget the Migration Assistant - it's convoluted and numerous settings have to be changed, so I updated my external drive (only 3 weeks lapse) and over a half a TB was quickly transferred.  All is good.  I've got my documents, photos, etc. & the Mac works SUPER QUICK and it is easy to grasp.  What isn't so easy, I Google or, actually, I Safari now.  I will NEVER go back to a PC.  I rate this Seller as an A+++++.  It had Monterey and I easily upgraded to Ventura.  It's like a whole new laptop and, I LOVE it.

That was unusable for anything outside of web browsing since I could not run any resource-heavy applications such as virtual machines or games. The battery life was amazing though.Now that I have an updated 14\" with 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, I can confidently say that this machine will be future proof for a long while. I can run multiple VMs, do code development, while running all of the miscellaneous applications at the same time. This is a beast.\\n\\n3 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I’m a mac user of many years.  The computer is blazing fast, slim, light with great battery life. A huge bonus—-little need for additional  anti virus add on software since the macbook anti virus platform is very solid. A hidden gem when you buy any apple device is phenomenal tech telephone support.  The advisors at the apple stores and by telephone are the best part of the apple experience for me and even rival the devices they sell. Yes, I hate the high prices and know the game but over time I’ve  accepted their price points because of the incredible tech support.\\n\\n6 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Super-powerful, super-fast and the rightsize. Compared to my 2019 13\" MBP, I love that they added HDMI and SDHC card ports back onto the laptop. So much simpler than having dongles everywhere.Apple\\'s supply chains are backed up right now for 4-6 weeks, and I went with this Amazon reseller because they had something in stock. Delivery was fast and the machine is a joy.One thing that really surprised me is that Apple\\'s prices are currently through the roof. This laptop, which uses the M1Pro chip and has 32Gb RAM and a 2Tb SSD, is considered \"middle of the road\" now in early 2022. And when a mid-level laptop costs over $4000 with AppleCare and tax, that means it\\'s out of reach for a lot of Mac lovers.

I’ve had the computer for about 3 months and the only thing I’ve noticed is that the speaker isn’t very loud on some videos. Some, not all. Other than that it’s great- battery was at 97% when I got it. It did come in an unremarkable box with a cheesy generic adapter, but what are you gonna do. For the price I’m definitely satisfied and am glad I got this one and not the Air. The screen is fabulous, doesn’t hurt my eyes as much and is great for photo editing.

I got a refurbished unit from Amazon for the savings. I was a little worried when it came, the box was a little beat up, it came in its factory box, but did not come with original charger. The charger they provided was brand new and works great. This MacBook is the fasted computer I have ever used, period. I dabble in music production and gaming. I have no complaints. The laptop was in perfect condition too, not a scratch on it. Check if the M1 works with any specific software you use prior to purchase, I had to wait for some that I use to work, no big deal, but if you use video editing software, or other processor heavy apps, double check. I don't know why people dislike the Touch Bar, I love it.\\n\\n31 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I can confidently say 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is underwhelming. Unless you are going to use this for light web browsing, you will find yourself wanting more RAM and more storage. Only having a game or two installed required a bit of a struggle when wanting to update the operating system because I was often under 20-30GB of usable storage. As for the RAM, I often had prompts telling me I ran out of system memory.Don't settle with the minimum spec, upgrade to at least 16GB of RAM at 512GB of storage minimum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

It forces you to either do everything wirelessly or buy an expensive dock station. But that being said, for a computer that is going on 6 years old it still runs as good as the day I bought it. I appreciate the fact Apple has continued to support it with software updates. I've never had a pc last this long without serious slowdowns or viruses. this MacBook got a lot of flack for various reasons when it came out but I love it!

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?  Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing. (I base this on what I got out of my 2010 Sony Vaio, which this outclasses.) Someone who runs multiple large programs may find issues with this computer.Other thoughts?  I am not a Mac fan. This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far. I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': ['Victorfabius5.0 out of 5 stars\\nExcellent Mobile Laptop IF You Understand The Macbook\\'s Limitations Before Purchase\\nReviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 20, 2015Verified Purchase\\nI am a Windows person.

I personally have a built computer with 2 512gb SSDs mac and windows, 4gb gfx card, 16gb ram, i7. If this was my only computer - well it wouldnt be. If you want a MBP buy a MBP. However, most of the people doing enough with their primary computer that would consider this a \\'secondary computer\\' should already know based on this computers specs its not built to beat what \\'you can get for the same price in an asus ROG gaming laptop\"There are mercedes and bmw\\'s that have less than 200hp, and cost more than new cars that have navigation and backup cameras. Some people will say they\\'re buying the brand, most of those people will never understand...So heres my experience with it.... for those of you that already know all about it and want to know how practical it is.The micro usb is GREAT. Third-party cables already work great, theres no right-side up like a lightning cable. Its somewhat futureproof for thunderbolt/usb3.1 at 10gb/s. The lack of usb is no bother, because the computer is thinner than USB, and when I need one the adapter is no bother. Not that I plan on this happening, but in my case I would be more likely to bend the cable now than the flash drive which is a bonus. I keep the adapter in my bag, and try to avoid using photo/video programs on this anyway. So dropbox and office 365 work great for me.The keyboard is fantastic. I have a mechanical keyboard that is still preferred but I appreciate how good this keyboard is. You just have to type on it for a while to understand. My palms rest right outside the trackpad, which I love how large it is! I havent got a chance to use force-touch too much (which is in 2015 MBP) each individual light is truly appealing. I had forgot about the feature until the keys lit up and gave me that WOW factor. The SPEAKERS are absolutely amazing. I will actually be using these a lot so personally I was really excited to hear they sound better than any other Macbook.It is SUPER Light. It has plenty of ram, and a retina display that is beautiful for viewing photos, surfing web, or watching videos. Personally I wouldnt even bother editing, and dont care. It has no fans, no graphics card, and a 1.1-1.3ghz processor. The board is SO SMALL!!!! But I would probably be impressed w/how well it would handle it! It uses bridge to manage my photos well until I get home.You will hear bad things about the \\'value\\' but you have to ask yourself what YOU VALUE. This will be very reliable, long lasting, it is SUPER light, can handle 90% of peoples needs (not all of mine) it is ultra thin end to end, its actually thinner than the MBAir where it charges (so thin a USB wouldnt fit...) if its more than you need its a fantastic computer. The retina display compensates for the small 12\" screen, and Id prefer it over a 11 or 13\" air. A lot of people will underestimate how nice it is to have a computer thats so light.Most cons I consider pros, because THE SPECS TELL YOU THE \"CONS\" only thing thats worse than not researching is researching and then buying it even thought youve discovered it doesn\\'t fit your individual needs.Some things you might not have considered yet...If you still want a light pc with no retina and less appeal you can get an air with an i5 for cheaperthe 12\" screen is small, I wish it was available in 12 and 14, id LOVE a 14 of this PC.

That laptop was the new MacBook, you may remember the old bulky plastic MacBook, but rest assured this computer’s only resemblance to its predecessor is the logo on the back. I purchased the MacBook in 2015 to replace my broken MacBook Pro Retina display. I was nervous about the major change of laptops; However, the new MacBook is a stunning piece of machinery to look at. It is a working work of art. I am currently a college student and needed a laptop that was both portable and reliable; the new MacBook weighs in at a stunning two pounds and is durable as it is made from aluminum. I have had this laptop for about five months now, so it has been thoroughly tested and I will give you my two cents as to what I loved and what I hated.Advantages:The first thing you will notice is the laptops thin design, it is the thinnest laptop on the market with height of half an inch at its ticked and .15 of an inch at its thinnest. It also is available in three colors; space grey for anyone looking for a blacked out laptop, gold for anyone who likes bling, and silver for anyone who likes to stay old-school. I choose the space grey as I didn’t want to be flashy with the gold and was tired of the silver color that had adorned my previous two laptops. There is also a beautiful retina display that I have come to expect from a Macintosh. The memory of the computer, at its standard model with 256 Gigabytes, has twice as much memory as the comparable MacBook pro with 128 Gigabytes. The battery is also long lasting as Apple had promised with the new battery design. The final advantage is the new keyboard, it uses the new butterfly mechanism and is the thinnest keyboard found on a laptop, at first I found it to be weird, now I absolutely love as it has increased my comfort while typing.Disadvantages:The number one thing that people will notice is the lack of a traditional USB port; instead, all of the charging and data transfers go through the new USB-C port, and there is only one. This was my number one concern with buying this laptop as the adapters are expensive and I choose not to buy them. I found this lack of ports to be a slight annoyance rather than a deal breaker as the only time I actually use a computer’s USB port is when I can’t find my wall USB adapter. Another disadvantage is that this computer is extremely expensive as it retails at the same price as the MacBook Pro, I would expect a price reduction with the reduction in size. My final complaint is its lack of compatibility with a Thunderbolt Display, something that I was not aware of, and essentially turned my one thousand dollar display into a paperweight.This computer is at the top of the market when it comes to price point and some people are not going to be willing to pay that for a computer. This computer is for the mobile person who needs a powerful laptop and appreciates a beautifully design. Remember to do your research, this laptop is not for everyone, it lacks some features that are considered standard to a laptop. However, what it lacks in features it makes up for with its beautiful design, simplicity of use, and portability.\\n\\n7 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Every machine has its strengths and weaknesses.  If I had to pick \"one machine for always\" -- the way the computer press plays things -- it would always be the ginormous, painful to haul laptop, because I earn my dinner with my computers and while the cars are nice, I need the truck.  And the combination of pen and OneNote in the Microsoft ecosystem is its own unique kind of excellence, especially when recording class notes at high speed.  There is no perfect single gleaming notebook, and if you need a work halogen don\\'t buy a perfectly nice 60 watt light bulb and complain.  .It is not a slouch.  I have XCode, Slickedit, Xamarin, Lightroom, Mathematica and Fusion Pro (with a Windoze and a Ubuntu VM) running on this Macbook.  It works perfectly well with each of them.  If you read the press, the impression is that it is hard pressed to open a spreadsheet and a word processing document at the same time.  This is simply untrue -- it is not the fastest beast in the world (see above) but it is reasonably snappy (way snappier than any notebook you own without an SSD).  Looking at free memory, it does seem to page less than my MBP, so some of this speed may be reduced latency on the memory.  But it doesn\\'t feel consistently slow or overburdened.I do like the 12 inch form factor (why I also have a surface) .  Not everyone does, but if you simply must have a computer with you at all times it is the smallest I have been able to go and retain productivity.The keyboard is fine.  I don\\'t know what people are used to to draw so many complaints, but I find it far superior to the surface keyboard if only because it is a solid block of aluminum.  The trackpad is the first Apple trackpad I\\'ve used that I did not immediately replace with a 2 button and scroll wheel windows mouse.  With just the computer and the built in trackpad, it is easy to precisely grab text, drag things, and bring up context menus -- and the consistent haptic feedback does not have the mushy feel I find on MBPs (because it\\'s simulated, of course -- but in this case the simulation beats the reality).I did expect that the text would seem different that the Pro 3 -- the Pro 3 is a handful of pixels per inch less dense, and I expected that this would be more like my last 13\" MBP.  It is a tiny tiny bit better but it isn\\'t the magic I expected over the Pro 3 -- the 12 inch screen means you have to put more stuff in a smaller space with smaller fonts, no matter how you pixelate it, and there is a tendency to put your nose on the screen.  That said it is an _excellent_ display and one I\\'m happy to look at for long periods.In short, this is probably the best go bag computer I\\'ve ever had, and I recommend it.  I am using it with a Moshi screen protector and a viper booq rigid case.\\n\\n17 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\n13 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I have had two iPods as well as an iPhone; however, I have never owned a Macbook. My decision to get a Macbook was an easy one, after my Windows machine quite running to its full potential. The problem I faced was what type of Macbook to purchase.For me, it was my final year of undergraduate school and I knew I needed something light weight, easily portable, and fast for graduate school. The 12 inch Macbook had just come out, which is half the reason I was so interested in it. It was brand new, no one I knew had it yet and it was advertised as the next best machine. The 13 inch Pro with retina was also in the running for me. I decided to go to the Apple store and look at the two models. I had thought to myself that the 12' screen may seem a bit small, in fact it does not seem small at all. The laptop is so sleek and thin that the size of it really doesn't seem too small. The computer is extremely light weight, so much so that I often forget it is my bag. The redesigned keyboard makes typing with ease a breeze. The screen quality is incredible with the retina display.Two simple critiques I would like to make you aware of are first, the fact that there are only two ports, one of which being a headphone jack. This is understandable considering how thin the laptop is. Although, I did have to purchase the Apple USB-C to plug into the charging port to give the computer USB and HDMI ports. It can be a little obnoxious at times having the USB-C port hanging off the side of the laptop, but overall it is worth it to have the sleekness and portability the laptop offers. The second critique, is the charger. It is a new designed charger that does not have a notification light on it when the laptop is charging verses fully charged. Overall, this is extremely minuscule, but just something I feel is convenient to to have. The good thing is the laptop has ~10 hours of battery life, so charging the laptop is a rarity. If you are in the market for a new laptop, the 12' Macbook is definitely. the way to go. With its portability, retina display, sleekness, and overall quality, it makes the journey of purchasing worth every penny. The only thing you will question after purchasing it, is why you did not invest sooner.\\n\\n11 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I had initially thought that the one port was a deal breaker for me - but honestly, it hasn\\'t been an issue.  I have had to adjust my charging habits, particularly when I am travelling abroad...I typically would travel with one international power adaptor (bulky) and charge my phone and tablet through my computer.  Not a possibility unless I want to travel with even more adaptors.  On the plus side, the Macbook only takes about two hours to go from a 2% charge to 100% charge.  With that I get about 6.5 hours of battery power working online with Chrome and slightly (but not dramatically more) working online with Safari.My major issue is that my trackpad completely stopped working within 40 days of buying the computer.  Since I\\'m away for the summer, the nearest Apple store is about four hours south of me.  After calling Apple I was told I needed to bring the Macbook into a store so off I went for a very long car ride only to find that the computer needed to be sent out for four days - not optimal as I run my business from it (plus two lost travel days).  It\\'s back now - working fine - but I don\\'t have a ton of faith in it (my old Air never had a single problem in the five years that I used it - heavily) and I am fairly disappointed that $1300 only bought me 40 days of trouble free usage...If you travel a lot the size and weight are fabulous - overall I really like using it.  Some folks have mentioned not caring for the new keyboard or tackpad - when both are working I didn\\'t find this to take any adjustment time at all.A number of reviewers have commented on price (some mentioning that the Air is a better deal) but if you configure the Air to have the same memory and storage - the prices seem pretty much the same.  I don\\'t notice any difference between my old Air and the new Macbook in regards to speed for what I use it for (running my business, online, office, mail, editing short video clips, skype etc.) Though I suspect this wouldn\\'t be a great fit for someone doing more intensive work - for me and my travel schedule this is a great machine.I\\'m fairly happy with it - but would have preferred to purchase the next generation, once all of the bugs were worked out etc.October 2015 Update:Half of the keyboard stopped working and Apple replaced the computer.January 2016 Update:The right side of the space bar and the bottom right side of the keyboard have stopped working on the replaced computer.  It\\'s a shame, I love the design of this machine, but it has been unreliable for me.\\n\\n10 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.  I got the Space Grey color and it looks amazing.  Upgrading from a MacBook Air, the size and weight difference felt like my previous transition from MacBook Pro to MacBook Air.  Portability is my primary concern.

It's is awesome for that purpose for many reasons:#1 Small size and weight for travel#2 Can recharge via USB-C.  This mean using USB battery banks, USB solar chargers, etc. to recharge off-the-grid is possible!

This is a huge visual upgrade from my MacBook Air that did not have Retina display.#4 Three laptop color options to choose from#5 Improved touch pad and keyboard lighting#6 Great battery life but not quite as long as MacBook Air.  However, the ability to recharge via USB makes the MacBook superior IMO.#7 USB-C to USB 3.0 converters can be inexpensively purchased to enable use of older USB 3.0 devices.  Also USB-C charging cables are cheap, so there is no need to feel tethered to Apple proprietary charging/synch cables like the iPad/iPhone/iPod use.For a casual user browsing the web, checking e-mail and editing photos this would be a perfect computer.  It's also suitable for someone like myself that performs Final Cut Pro X field video edits.  I can even edit 4K video with it!  For a power user requiring Thunderbolt for additional displays and/or external storage this would not be the perfect option.  This computer has two ports...a USB-C on one side that doubles as the charging port and a headphone jack on the other.  It's a very minimalist design.I'm completely satisfied with my purchase but being a power/volume video editor, I couldn't justify this being my one computer.  Since it is my secondary field computer, this combined with my primary iMac with Retina 5K Display computer is the perfect combo!  I also like how the base model comes with 256GB flash.  That's more than enough space for my travel needs.  I personally couldn't justify spending more for the 512GB flash version with a slightly faster CPU.  For its intended function, the base model of the 2015 MacBook is perfect in my opinion.

I\\'m going to recommend these guys to everyone I know who is looking to buy a laptop. Here\\'s my experience in a nutshell:I didn\\'t get the exact color I wanted. I specified \"gold\" and when I received the color I got a \"space gray\". I wasn\\'t too happy about it and I didn\\'t want to have to go through the hassle of sending it back just to wait for the one I had wanted. So I emailed them and received a reply in just a few short minutes. The company was so quick at getting back to me and we worked out a deal that was more than fair. I can honesty say I appreciate their customer service and they will come highly recommended from me in the future. The seller I bought it from was CELLITNOW and if any potential laptop buyers want to get a quality product at a great price, check out their inventory first.Ok, now for the actual product. This is a beautiful laptop. My old macbook air 11in from 2010 had exploded. Yes, you read that correctly. After 5 faithful years and many hours together, my little air decided to explode. One day I noticed that it didn\\'t close correctly and the keyboard had become all warped because something internal had blown up. It was a sad day.Well, I didn\\'t really have the funds to immediately go out and purchase another macbook so I just used my iPad for the time being and bought a mini keyboard to go with it. No complaints on it, but it wasn\\'t a Macbook by far.I\\'m glad I went out and got this guy. It so sleek and quiet. And the retina display really does make a difference when compared to the macbook airs. I\\'m loving this guy so far. I had my sister\\'s boyfriend (who is a pretty avid gamer) take a look at the specs and he said on a gamer level, this was an alright computer, but for everything I would need it for (browsing on the internet, doing basic typing and light editing) this was perfect.All in all, another fantastic product from apple. Let\\'s just hope this one doesn\\'t explode too.

The info said it was actually brand new (it was) and I was getting it for slightly less than the same machine at Apple\\'s refurbished page.  I can\\'t fault anyone but myself for not looking more closely.  Though the MacBook has never been used, the serial number had been registered with Apple over 10 months before I purchased it.  That means I have less than two months of original warranty left.  The only way to keep it protected was to add AppleCare, which I would have done anyway, but I would have waited a number of months to do so.The second difference between this and an Apple refurb is that the one from Apple would have arrived with the latest OS already on it.  I knew ahead of time that I would have to upgrade this to Sierra before I could port my settings and data over to it.  That upgrade was simple and free, but it cost me a couple of extra hours at a time when I was in a hurry.Please note that I am not faulting the seller for these things.  I go what I paid for, but it wasn\\'t quite as good a deal as I thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?  Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing. (I base this on what I got out of my 2010 Sony Vaio, which this outclasses.) Someone who runs multiple large programs may find issues with this computer.Other thoughts?  I am not a Mac fan. This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far. I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': [\"Jesse Hicks5.0 out of 5 stars\\nAmazing!!!\\nReviewed in the United States on March 11, 2017Verified Purchase\\nThe MacBook came with all of its accessories except for the extension and it was neatly packaged.

I got this computer as a secondary more portable supplement.  However, I now find myself using it as my primary computer. I really like the keyboard (over the one on the Pro) and the portability just makes it easy to carry around. I am sure that I will use the Pro when I need more computing power, but the reality is, that for most of my tasks, this MacBook is powerful enough. I often make graphs on excel, import those to the powerpoint that I am preparing, while also running a statistical software.

I absolutely hated it at first, but then I grew to love it; the bigger keys outweighed the con of such little key travel. I really did not think I would need the USB port, but when it came time to update my phone (since Apple likes to send me daily reminders) I kept forgetting that I couldn\\'t plug my phone in. (I like updating through iTunes, not on my phone, to save space.)This is a very beautiful laptop, but it just wasn\\'t going to work for me. I think this is a great first laptop to get. I was in the market for a lighter and smaller computer after my 15\" Pro broke. But I ended up returning this for a 13\" Pro because I already had an iPad which is essentially similar to this laptop and it was half the price. When it comes down to it, it didn\\'t make sense to buy this. It was overpriced when Apple first introduced it, and I really do not recommend paying more than $1000 for this. It\\'s more sensible and logical to me to get the 13\" Air or Pro for a better bang for your buck. If you\\'re adamant about getting this laptop, and you don\\'t mind getting an old one, I would suggest getting a used or refurbished one.\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I felt the same. I did tons of research on this little macbook, and read everywhere that the specs \"suck\". I ignored all of that and went for it. Trusting my instincts I was right. In the end it\\'s a Macbook, and I felt that apple will not make a computer not capable of doing the things is necessary. And I use this for video editing in iMovie, and Final Cut Pro. Yes, the macbook is A BIT slower then the pro, comparing to my girlfriends 2016 model. But idc. It\\'s not a $500 difference, if you can get this macbook for under 800, go for it. It will suit your needs if your on a budget. Mine took a couple more days to come because of the storm up north, and it did not come with the original cable or a box.

It would double space when I pressed it once or not respond at all or sometimes even work properly. I took the device in to Apple to see about getting it repaired. I was quoted between $350 and $550 as I was told the entire guts of the laptop had to be replaced to fix the keyboard. That\\'s not really my problem, Apple, that\\'s yours. I refused to pay that much for a bad spacebar. I\\'d read that other people were beginning to have issues with keyboards too and mentioned that at the Genius Bar, but was told it wasn\\'t something Apple was covering as an issue. I ended up donating it and bought a Surface Pro instead. A year later Apple admits the design is s$$t and is now replacing them under extended warranty. Doesn\\'t help me any. I\\'ll never buy another Apple product after this and other problems I\\'ve had with their overpriced products.Original review:Despite some of its limitations I\\'m quite happy with the Macbook 12\". Love this little laptop much more than the Macbook Air 11\" I tried first. The keyboard might not be a good fit for everyone, but I have no problems with it. Took a few seconds of adjustment to get used to the key travel changes, but since then it\\'s been great and responsive. I was a bit worried about the single USB-C port, but as with the Air, I rarely plug any externals in, so it\\'s unlikely to be an issue. Sure a second port would have been preferred, but so far I haven\\'t needed to use it but for charging.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me.

I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen?

Not sure if this will lead to functional issues in the future, beyond warranty coverage.I had a GREAT experience with Amazon buying this product.APPLE is to blame for what I see as poor quality control relating to the production of this laptop.I returned this laptop to Amazon and bought another from Apple.

This looked elegant, was new, and had the upgrades I wanted. However, one port?! Not even two where you could charge while using a peripheral. While Apple would think I'm mincing here, moving my info from my old mac's back up was on a usb drive. I had to unplug the power to migrate that info to the new mac. Alas! I was told to keep my new mac powered during the process. Asinine. I didn't and it worked out but it's ridiculous to not have even two ports. Unless you buy the port splitter for $80.So in summary: Solid design and function like all macs, a little expensive, and ridiculous there is only one port.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?  Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing.

Speed wise, it's not an i5 or an i7 so comparing this to a higher end MacBook Pro is not something that will have this new revised MacBook come out on top of any speed tests.  But for what I use it for (web, email, writing, music, Netflix, Hulu, Photoshop, Dreamweaver) it's plenty fast for me.  Plus almost 9 hours of battery life.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?  Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing. (I base this on what I got out of my 2010 Sony Vaio, which this outclasses.) Someone who runs multiple large programs may find issues with this computer.Other thoughts?  I am not a Mac fan. This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far. I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': [\"Amazon Customer3.0 out of 5 stars\\nNot Refurbished\\nReviewed in the United States on January 11, 2018Verified Purchase\\nWhen the laptop arrived it's previous owner's account was still on the computer.

The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': [\"Amazon Customer1.0 out of 5 stars\\nFirst major disappointment with an Apple laptop.\\nReviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 15, 2015Verified Purchase\\nThis computer is very thin but the performance is the worst amongst all the Macs I have owned.Battery life - I didn't time it precisely, but after I installed Chrome browser, battery got burnt down within 3 hours.  The 8 or 9 hours of video playback time was not there at all. Watching on Netflix in Chrome barely last 2 hours.  Something isn't right with this computer.

Granted I have a large email inbox, but 5 days is just too long to index.Apps - I have very frequent hang-ons in Apple Mail, Skype, and even in Safari.Apple seems in general is producing less quality nowadays.

I took it to the Apple store where they told be that it is done, there was nothing they could do to make it work. John at Datavision refused to return my money after returning the Macbook to the company since it was not returned in the original packaging.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?  Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing. (I base this on what I got out of my 2010 Sony Vaio, which this outclasses.) Someone who runs multiple large programs may find issues with this computer.Other thoughts?  I am not a Mac fan. This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far. I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think.

Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing.

This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far. I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': [\"Rachie P2.0 out of 5 stars\\nGold apple macbook 2015\\nReviewed in the United States on July 19, 2015Verified Purchase\\nI purchased my new Gold Macbook on 22 June and already it stopped working.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?

Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing. (I base this on what I got out of my 2010 Sony Vaio, which this outclasses.) Someone who runs multiple large programs may find issues with this computer.Other thoughts?  I am not a Mac fan. This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far. I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': [\"Allen King5.0 out of 5 stars\\nGreat laptop!\\nReviewed in the United States on June 24, 2016Verified Purchase\\nIt's an Apple product...

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too.

I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': ['Dj Johnson5.0 out of 5 stars\\nBasically brand new\\nReviewed in the United States on September 25, 2016Verified Purchase\\nWorks as said.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility.

I am coming from using a 2010 Macbook pro so even though the specs on the 2010 are \"better\", this macbook is so much faster in every way and the screen really is amazing. I can have the brightness set to 50% and still be able to clearly see what I\\'m looking at, whereas before I would usually have to set brightness at 100% to not strain my eyes. I was worried that the laptop is too small from looking at the outside shell and that the screen would be as well. But, that\\'s not the case and the screen feels just as big as my previous macbook pro that was 13.3 I think. From reading other reviews, you would think the keyboard is a horrible thing, but it really has not been a big deal to get used to and I\\'ve come to enjoy typing on this just as much as my previous Mac. The keys don\\'t need to be pressed hard or deep and I think my typing has actually gotten faster because of this.The main reasons I gave it 4 stars and not 5 are the obvious lack of ports and the battery. Though they are not huge issues unless you need to plug in several things or take your laptop on the road for 6+ hours at a time, which I don\\'t, but still feel Apple could have done better. I bought a usb connector with 4 usb ports (14$) and had my printer, camera, and mouse plugged in and there was no lag or slow down at all, so the usb-c port works very well. I didn\\'t want to have to buy the more expensive adaptor that included a c-port so that you can charge at the same time, but that would have been nice if only Apple had included a 2nd usb-c port on the other side, but oh well. I am able to go through about 2.5 days without charging the laptop and doing normal web browsing, videos, and mail, which is decent. Though I would say my actual use time is about 3 hours per day, some times less.All in all I am very happy with my purchase of this Macbook instead of the Pro. The size and weight is perfect and it really is a beautiful piece of technology. Another major plus that I didn\\'t realize would be so impactful, this machine is absolutely silent. I have used it for over an hour straight and it is virtually silent and I have not felt it get much hotter than normal. This doesn\\'t seem that important, but it really makes it much more pleasant to use than other laptops that get loud and hot within 20 minutes of use, as my old Mac did, though it was 5 years old. As others have stated several times, if you\\'re looking to use intensive and power hungry apps to get work done, then this Mac is not for you!*Update* 1/23/2016This has been my primary laptop now for a little over 7 months and the veil of having Apple\\'s sleek new ultra portable laptop has been lifted from my eyes. The laptop is okay, and in the end I don\\'t feel that it was worth the $1200 I spent on it because of lack of processing power and ports that I originally thought would be no big deal. The truth is, even simple web browsing with a few tabs open along with another app like mail causes the machine to struggle a bit with load times and causing the pages to stutter while scrolling. It has become annoying having to unplug my mouse just to attach the printer or charge the laptop, and I don\\'t want to have to buy a 70$ adapter just to be able to do that. Again, at first I thought it would be no issue at all since I don\\'t really plug in much to my laptop, but over time it has gotten to me. Another issue, the keyboard really is horrible compared to the MacBook pro and air! I thought it was neat at first and easy to use, but since the keys are so shallow if you have to type a lot it gets pretty annoying with the keys being so close together and sometimes not registering, so it causes a lot of errors while typing and it\\'s just unsatisfying not to have the clicking of keys. The battery lasts maybe 5-7 hours of continuous use, granted I do put the brightness on the high end but what\\'s the purpose of having a beautiful retina screen if you\\'re going to put it on low brightness and struggle to see the screen? I really wanted this to be an amazing laptop and make an effort to get to love it, but, all in all, I would not recommend this laptop for the price, lack of features, and goofy keyboard and suggest going for the Pro or Air instead.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          13 people found this helpful'], 'All_Reviews': ['Anthony P.

It has everything I needed to do my work and nothing I didn\\'t need. It was a great combination of size, price, performance and usability.  But after three-plus years, it is time to choose a successor.My method to pick my everyday computer is pretty straight forward: Set my critera, choose candidate models, and then narrow down the list to one.  The 2015 MacBook was announced while I was going thru this process.  At first glance, it did not seem that the new MacBook would be a candidate. It seemed pricey, it was a first-gen model, and it looked fragile.  But after playing with it at the Apple Store, I saw no reason to eliminate it from the list.My criteria for the replacement was simple: I needed a mid-sized computer (no 11-inch or 15-inch models), 8GB RAM (this is a must-have), in the $1200 range (to match my $1/day computer budget), with an all-day battery (no charging required for at least 8 hours of usage).  These were all hard requirements.  Other nice-to-have options were Retina display (but I can live with non-Retina), 256GB storage (though I can make-do with 128GB) and lighter the better.You may have noticed that matching some arbitrary performance benchmarks was not a requirement.  That\\'s because any and all of the current generation Apple computers are more than sufficient to accomplish my daily tasks: Firefox for Web Browsing, Word and Excel for documents and spreadsheets, Photoshop & Lightroom for viewing and editing photos, and XCode along with some Terminal tools for  development work.  In fact, I could have continued to use my 4-year old MacBook Air for these tasks were it not for its 4GB RAM and (now puny) 4-hour battery.After a little bit of browsing on the Apple online store, I chose the following computers for my list (all prices are from the Educational Store and without tax/shipping):Model  Price  RAM  Storage  Battery  Display  Weight13\" Air  1039  8GB  128GB  12 Hrs.  Non  2.5 lbs13\" Pro  1199  8GB  128GB  10 Hrs.  Retina  3.0 lbs13\" Air  1239  8GB  256GB  12 Hrs.  Non  2.5 lbs12\" Macbook  1249  8GB  256GB  9 Hrs.  Retina  2.0 lbs13\" Pro  1399  8GB  256GB  10 Hrs.  Retina  3.0 lbsThe next few steps were just a process of elimination.  First, I removed the outliers:  The 13\" Pro ($1399) was far outside my budget and therefore the first to go.  The 13\" Air (for $1039) had its low price as an advantage, but since others offered more while meeting the budget, it was also eliminated.  The new list now looked like this:Model  Price  RAM  Storage  Battery  Display  Weight13\" Pro  1199  8GB  128GB  10 Hrs.  Retina  3.0 lbs13\" Air  1239  8GB  256GB  12 Hrs.  Non  2.5 lbs12\" Macbook  1249  8GB  256GB  9 Hrs.  Retina  2.0 lbsI could also eliminate the Price and RAM criteria now, since all models were 8GB and price variation was less than 5%:Model  Storage  Battery  Display  Weight13\" Pro  128GB  10 Hrs.  Retina  3.0 lbs13\" Air  256GB  12 Hrs.  Non  2.5 lbs12\" MacBook  256GB  9 Hrs.  Retina  2.0 lbsSo the decision really came down to the nice-to-have options.  The 13\" Pro gets a +1 for Retina, 13\" Air gets a +1 for 256GB storage, but the MacBook gets +2 for having both Retina and 256GB.  On top of that, it is the lightest of all candidates (another +0.5 maybe?).  I think we have a clear winner!Now, how to choose between Silver, Gold and Space Grey?\\n\\n25 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

But I can like the Macbook, too.I actually got this from Apple, but you will notice the \"Verified Purchase\" on the review. There\\'s a reason, and it isn\\'t so that I can post a fake review. Quick story is that I tried to buy another one of these from a 3rd Party Seller, who had no intention of actually selling, and I had to file an A-Z claim against them. So, this is an actual review of the Apple Macbook 12\".Why did I buy this?  I saw that Apple had released a new product that included no cooling fans. I looked into it and found that what they had done was quite ingenious, like what Microsoft did with their Surface Pro line: something new and very interesting. So, I purchased it from Apple.Would I buy this again?  Yes. I even tried to. (At a too-good-to-be-true price.)What is it?  I own the Macbook 12\" Gold with 256GB SSD and the 1.3GHz processor. It could be said that this is the chromebook equivalent for macs. (Chromebook functionality and mass with Apple\\'s price tags.) It is an internet dependent machine, requiring wi-fi access to take advantage of the utility of the device. It is an extremely mobile laptop, lighter than the Air series and lighter than almost every other laptop on the market as of its release.What do I like?  Here\\'s where I start gushing. I really like the fanless design. Yes, this means that it gets pretty warm at high usage, but not too hot to touch. It runs completely silently, with the only sound coming from the keyboard or speakers. The screen is a delightful Retina display, brilliant in color and resolution. Fast wi-fi connects with my a/ac/b/g/n network at home and gets great speeds. Keyboard took a moment to get used to, but is now one of the true assets of the device. I get the tactile response I need to type well on an ultra-thin keyboard. Backlit keys offer little light bleed, making nighttime use much easier on the eyes. I adore the fact that I can recharge the battery with a mobile battery pack (I use the Anker 26000Amp charger. Feels like it doubles the battery life.). I learned how to use OSX specifically so I could use this laptop, and it was time well spent. Even at the lower end of the capacity chain at 256GB, I still have plenty of room for all that I need to do with the computer. Runs most applications smoothly, and I can do voice recordings with ease straight to the computer. Since it operates without fans, the Macbook is not a sound one has to edit out and can be brought into the recording studio without fear of hums. There\\'s a lot to like.What do I dislike?  As with everyone else on the planet, the restriction to one USB-C port is a negative. However, it\\'s not such a hinderance with one USB-C hub and one USB hub attached to that. It would be nice if 3rd party USB-C hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging (or, on some, allowed to charging at all.... you know who you are.). If you are buying this computer, then you should already know about that restriction. Battery life does not quite reach Apple\\'s claims. More like 6-7 hours of continuous use. Outside of that, very few things about this computer I actually dislike. It does not have the processing power I\\'m used to, but going from a recently constructed home built desktop to a laptop, this is going to happen. Requiring purchase of additional items for backward compatibility for USB devices (such as storage or peripherals) is a disadvantage, too. Overpriced for what you get, but that\\'s the cost of doing business with Apple.What did I give it 5 Stars?  The flaws, which are a known quantity, are not hinderances to utility. A hurdle, sure, but not one with a high bar. The fact is this is an amazing machine. It\\'s not a gaming laptop, does not provide the power for most games, though it can run some (I was surprised it could run realMyst at all, even if not well). But it doesn\\'t pretend to be. This laptop is for those wishing to experience web-based services wherever they are. It provides a brilliant display for streaming. The strengths greatly outweigh the disadvantages for me. I absolutely love it.Who might like this?  Anyone on the go who has lots of wifi access. Those who need to have access to a computer wherever they are will find great value in this computer. With lots of hard drive space for a mac, this is also for people who like to use specific applications anywhere: whether at home, at a friends, at work, on the train, on the bus or on a plane.Who might dislike this?  Someone who needs processing power or works with video editing. Great for viewing videos, but not so great at editing. It is about at the level of 2011/2012 average processing. (I base this on what I got out of my 2010 Sony Vaio, which this outclasses.) Someone who runs multiple large programs may find issues with this computer.Other thoughts?  I am not a Mac fan. This computer is actually the first Mac I\\'ve ever kept for more than 10 days. I strongly stand behind this purchase, expensive as it was. I\\'ve begun to use it daily in favor of the desktop I built. I don\\'t play games on the Macbook, but then, I don\\'t need to. I\\'m not a Mac convert yet, but I\\'m appreciating them a lot more than before.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          23 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewAll critical reviews› Mateo2.0 out of 5 starsGreat portable and simple laptop *Update*....not so great 7 months laterReviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015This review is one week into using this new macbook, and I have to say it\\'s been awesome so far.

I have been a Mac book user for years. This is the first refurbished or factory recertified model that I’ve ever purchased, but it had all the internal components that I was looking for. I was a little bit nervous, but the return policy through Amazon, which is actually through Apple as this is from Apple via Amazon relieve that stress. After reading some of the reviews about the battery cycles being high, I was still very nervous. But I prevailed in the fact that mine has two cycles ran on the battery and is at 100%. It also still has one year left on the factory warranty through Apple  which means it was purchased and someone either returned it cause I didn’t like it or the new one came out because they purchased it had to of been around the release of M2 chip set. I actually purchased a secondary one in Rosegold for my wife and hers came with five cycles on it and still 100% battery. Those numbers are according to the bios inside the computer not from advertisements from Amazon or Apple. Tremendous purchase for the price, as on Black Friday for a brand new one it was still $200 above this list price that we paid and it’s now post Black Friday almost $400 more than we paid. Again it is not the newest ship set with the M2, but it will blow the doors off any Intel chip set that you will ever use the smart, save the money by a couple HomePod minis in the cost savings or take a nice little weekend vacation.\\n\\n11 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I had debated on buying a brand new M1 Air but the prices on Amazon seemed to be all over the place for a Space Grey one. I found this used M1 Air and I have to say...I am very impressed.The box that it came in was the original box, albeit a little dirty and sticky from tape residue. But it's a box, who cares. The Mac itself however is virtually pristine. There were 2 very small scuff marks on the bottom which is to be a bit expected. Absolutely no marks or scratches on the top of it. Inside, I haven't found any marks or messed up keys on the keyboard, no dead pixels on the screen, nothing.Battery life is what I was worried about the most though. Some reviews are claiming that their device only came with about 90% battery. While not terrible, that's still impacting the longevity of it before you have to spend $200 on a new battery. My Mac came with 100% battery health as if it's in rarely been used.I could go on and on about how nice this Mac is but I won't. There are plenty of reviews that will go over that for you. I just wanted to mention the shipper itself. I am very impressed and extremely happy with it.\\n\\n13 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I decided to just take the chance because if it wasn't what I was expecting then I would have been able to return it anyways. However, I got it and I couldn't even tell it was used. It comes secured in a bubble wrap then in a regular box to help protect it while being delivered here. It charged to 100% in less than an hour, no damage and after having it for a few days, I have not noticed anything wrong with the system. It works up to standard. The only thing is I am in the army and I bought a new CAC reader to go along with it and totally forgot that these new laptops do not have a regular USB hookup so keep that in mind. I did have to end up getting an adapter because it only has a C-type port. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.\\n\\n17 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I’m happy to say that it is the real deal and that I have had zero issues since purchasing. I have not found any cosmetic damage, the computer works as intended, and I was able to connect my Apple ID without problems. I use this several times a week for lighter personal work— mostly browsing the internet, hanging out with friends, and listening to music.The battery life is great (only charge it every couple of days). The screen is in great condition. The keyboard is like butter (I love typing on Macs). If you type a lot like I do, I would highly recommend this! This is also great for school work or anything else you need. I would not recommend for gaming though due to specs.\\n\\n19 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

But there's no touch screen.\\nReviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022Verified Purchase\\nThis MacBookAir is great...thin, excellent performance and battery life, good audio and microphone.  Note that it has only two ports, both USB-C.  That's it.  no headphone jack, no old style USB jack.  That makes it slim, but difficult to connect your old peripherals without converter plugs.

I decided I should question my bias against apple products. At the time they used to be locked and hard to integrate with other non apple products. But over the years the ecosystem has been more accomodating, though not open in the very least. Better stated there are workarounds.When it finally time to update my laptop I decided to cross the devide and pick up the latest M1 MacBook Air. With the hype of M1 chip and reliability. I thought it would be a good starting product. The laptop is beautiful, well built and seamless once you learn to use it. And there was a learning curve for me.Though the issues started to arrise less than a year with the laptop. It would freeze, the mouse would drag and stutter. I would require to shut it down as some of the apple apps wouldn't open or close. Particularly notepad. Only one day months before the year mark it completely refused to turn on.I have never had a mother board or hardware issue with any of my laptops over the years, let alone a mother board less than a year in. With a product touted as one of the most reliable world wide and not forgetting most expensive.Given that I moved to Kenya when this happened, I went to the closest support teams licensed by apple. Who informed me of the issue. With the fix, a new motherboard that needs to be shipped from California. Which would take 2-3months. For a product I'm still paying off. So, with hind sight being 20/20 take everything with a grain of salt. Apple make a beautiful product but it's still a fallable over hypped machine.\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I use earbuds or wired headphones. So, it wasn't until much later that I discovered the MacBook Air's internal speakers were not working. I took it to the apple store, and they came back with pictures of water damage and corrosion and told me that it would be $799 to fix it, or I could get a new one for $999. I just bought It refurbished six months ago so I tried to go back to the vendor APLCOMO. But it was after the 90-day warranty so I'm out the money. buyer beware. Have you purchase checked out before the warranty is up or your stuck with it.

The battery would randomly die at 50% sometimes and I also had problems with the charger getting incredibly hot. That could be normal, but it didn't seem like it. I do think this is a great price for the product, but also, if I am spending over$1,000 on a computer, I do not want to deal with any issues like the battery. I also had to do some repairing of the drive and troubleshooting to get it to download any of the updates. I spent two days trying to update the computer. I recommend the computer but you may want to run some tests on battery life when you get it. Also, this is a 2013 and for some reason, I did not find that super clear. This was not a problem at all for me but just good information.\\n\\n4 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

But after maybe 2 weeks, it began crashing randomly. I read threads online about battery issues and such with this model. Tried all of the troubleshooting, software updates, etc. recommended, and it’s still doing it. I’ve seen other people say they’ve had success with having their faulty laptops replaced. But for me, it’s too much hassle to risk getting another lemon of a laptop.

I ordered the M1 512gb with 8gb RAM. I ended up receiving the computer but it had 16gb RAM. I’m not mad by any means, however, if it had been the other way around I would’ve been upset. The computer itself was in near perfect condition. It runs extremely well using FCPX, Adobe Lightroom, and Logic. I would highly recommend this computer for any creator, it’s incredibly fast and powerful compared to previous models. For your average user, this computer is more than you need. You could go with a M1 with less storage and save some money. I use an external 4TB hard drive with mine, so space wasn’t an issue when purchasing.With everything being said, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade from even the top models from the last few years. I’d 100% purchase again.\\n\\n3 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Didn’t stop me from utilizing it, though. Sadly, it died, with the help of my kid deleting the HD, so I needed a new one. This thing is awesome. Battery lasts DAYS. I think I have to charge it (depending on usage) once every week or two. Definitely no complaints here. Device was as stated, clean (no scratches or dents), and performs as it’s supposed to.\\n\\n6 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

PC had some sort of service sticker on the bottom which I took off, other than that did not look like it was used more than a few days. Only had 6 charge cycles on the battery (100% life on it) and when I checked the SN for warranty information I was very pleasantly surprised that it had applecare on it for 3 MORE years!

I did so carefully enquiring about their return policy. At the time of purchase, I was guaranteed a 90 days return policy at the click of a button. This was an overseas purchase to Qatar and Amazon guaranteed, If I do not like the product they will arrange for the collection and refund the money. Based on this guarantee I purchased this MacBook Pro.The MacBook Pro that I received was in very good condition (Nov 2020 build) with only about 22 charge cycles. It worked fine for the first two months. Unfortunately suddenly one day it started having failures. The keyboard, Touch pad and the Wi-Fi stopped working & finally it was unable to boot up & was responsive only in boot up screen using external keyboard mouse & Lan. Upon initiating, a return with Amazon, the only option they were providing was mail in. I checked with all available service providers like DHL, Aramex, FedEx, UPS but due to an existing policy of Qatar, restricting battery products in flight none of the carriers could ship the MacBook back to Amazon USA, without a MSDS of the battery, which is not available for the MacBook. After many repeated calls, emails & conversations with the Amazon team, no solution could be found, and they declined to refund or collect, unless I could mail in the MacBook.Absolutely disheartened, I turned to Apple Service Center and requested their team to take a look under the hood and help me any which way possible. The repair bill was almost 70% of the purchase cost. After explaining my situation to their call center within 3 days they discussed my case with management. Since it was almost an unused MacBook, and for me to have a good first time experience, Apple agreed to replace and repair damaged parts for FREE. Hurray to Apple & their customer service. Deeply appreciate !!\\n\\nOne person found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

I have always used microsoft platforms but since getting an iPhone, I like their platform better. It is so handy to have everything on my phone show up in my Mac Air without me having to figure it all out. I do use Apple cloud too so that helps. This laptop is lightweight, doesn’t require a cooling fan so I can use it directly on my lap in my recliner.

Resetting to factory apparently bricks the system, and half the programs are running on an emulator. This is why Apple has not released them in their flagship models yet (ie 16\" Pro) ... too many bugs to work out. I felt purchasing an M1 at this time would be like being a free \"beta tester\" for Apple; no thanks, I\\'ll wait until everything\\'s solid again.• Core i7 upgrade is just negligible. Evaluating online benchmarks as well as real-world use tests seemed to indicate that this i5 works practically identically to the more expensive i7. Paying for the i7 version would be like throwing bad money after good, if you know what I mean.• 128Gb and 256Gb are too little, but 512Gb is perfect for most people and purposes, and if more space is necessary, then an external HD was probably always in the future no matter what, so why pay $300 extra for only 500 more Gbs integrated?My received unit was most likely a floor model based on its battery time and cord condition, which is perfect, and it feels like brand new. Delivery was spot on time. Can\\'t say enough about how well it works and fulfills all needs and purposes at such a higher level than my previous laptop, a 2017 Air 13\". Highly recommend if you can get it at such a reasonable price point. This review will be valid until probably early 2022, at which time, or shortly thereafter, the new M1s will blow this one out of the water... and I\\'ll have to upgrade again... {sigh}.\\n\\n43 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

When looking for a mac around the same price range I found this renewed Macbook Pro from the same year, 2020, with pretty good specs. I was skeptical about buying a renewed product but it was completely worth it! I felt like it wasn't going to come in the original box and have some scratches, as well as the battery cycles, being high but it was basically brand new, it had around 30 battery cycles, had no scratches, and came in the original box. On the Apple website, I found the same model for 1799$ new, I got this renewed model for 1150$ and it was basically brand new.

Solid and fast.\\nReviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021Verified Purchase\\nI ordered this MacBook to replace my previous 2012 MacBook and I absolutely love it. After using it for a week I ordered another one to have with me as a backup. I travel and use my laptop for work, so I always need a backup with me that can be ready to go if needed. In the past 12 years I’ve needed my backup MacBook 4 times. Once in St. Barts, once in Moscow, once in England and once in Abu Dhabi. So I’m really happy to have both of these. I use a 2tb Sandisk SSD external and the speed is crazy fast. I also carry a backup ext as well. And man are these lighter than my 2012s I was carrying around. Solid buy.

I was so excited I took photos and posted on my social media! The laptop itself was in perfect condition and has no signs that this was refurbished and previously owned - IT LOOKS BRAND NEW!I then started to set the laptop up. When I did there was a glitch on the screen and this happened three times; twice while setting up and once a few days later. This glitch looks as if the color levels were off and that the screen was cracked or damaged. I did not like this one bit. I have had this for a few weeks now and it hasn't shown any of these glitches since then.My MAIN complaint is the battery life. I have NO apps going, NO background data going. And the battery life is horrible.Once this laptop bites the dust, I will be going back to Toshiba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

There were only 5 battery cycles on it. I’ve used it for a night now, and tested out various features and everything’s running smoothly. I’ll update if that changes.

After endless bootloops, I decided to go Air as my office/home needs have changed and I don't require the size of a Pro anymore. Granted this is a couple of years old, it's still on the M1 chip, so future software updates won't be a problem (🙏🏿).Shipping was via UPS and always a bit late, but it arrived on time and in the original packaging (nice touch since the description specifically stated it would NOT).Booted fresh with a decent charge. Zero issues with anything at all so far (> 3 months).\\n\\n5 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

Was the switchover hard you ask?  YES....  Not really HA.  I assumed I need more in the hardware specs than I really did.  I was leery of 8 GB being enough.  It was.  I did want the 512 GB of local storage because I don\\'t trust some items with \"the cloud\".  Then on a schedule I do a dump to a local device to device backup.  What an I most impressed with?  The screen is beautiful.  Crisp and clear.  The M1 chip is quite fast enough for me and saved me some money on the certified used market.  I find many times the things on did on Windows at a corporate level made me overthink how to do it on the Mac.  And yes, sometimes I embarassed myself because some keystrokes are different.  I said different not difficult.  Example:  I have a Canon Color lazer printer. About 5 years old.  This OS found it, put very simple menus up front, and it runs wirelessly with less hassles than Windows did.  This Mac sits on my desk overnite.  Plugged into power.  If I took it off in the morning, and did my usual Amazon shopping, Kindle reading, email sending and such, the battery will be at roughly 60% when I go to bed.  I also have a 3rd gen MacBook Pro, which is lighter and will last just a bit longer in the battery, but I have retired it and use this exclusively.  And with no fan, it is truly noiseless and I don\\'t need to worry if there is a piece of paper hiding under it when I sit it down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport abuse\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

WOW! The speed! The display! The sound! I\\'m not a person who needs the newest tech, so this was a quantum leap for me. Very impressed with the speed of the M1 chip (been told its a better value than the newer and more expensive M2 chip...). Pretty easy to DIY the data migration from the old MacBook to this one, very pleased with that.One thing to mention if you\\'re looking for a \"deal\" on a MacBook - make sure it has been \"Renewed\" or \"Refurbished\", NOT \"Used - Very Good\" - I\\'d purchased a Used / Very Good MacBook through Amazon, and when it arrived, found the original owner\\'s ID had never been scrubbed, so I was unable to use it (seriously).
